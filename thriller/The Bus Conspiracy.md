# The Bus Conspiracy

In bustling Mumbai, Rohan and Neha met on a bus, sparking an immediate connection. At the last stop they were the only ones left in the bus. Their bus journey took a dark turn when it met with an accident.

They were rushed to a hospital, but Rohan was baffled when told he'd been hit by a car, not in a bus accident. Worse, Neha was in a coma. A mysterious nurse whispered the truth to Rohan; they were indeed in a bus accident and Neha had been put in a coma and next would be him.

Rohan, determined to unravel this mystery, dressed Neha as a nurse and fled the hospital. Back home, they discovered that there was no news of the accident. 

They ventured to the remote village where the accident occurred but were met with silence, except from a beggar who warned them to run.

Undeterred, they uncovered a sinister plot involving a powerful politician who orchestrated the bus accident to silence Sheetal, Neha's twin sister, who had exposed his crimes against children.
Sheetal had received a free travel ticker but because she was busy, Neha took it instead.
Rohan just happended to be unlucky because he boarded the bus after seeing Neha.

Confronting the politician, they presented evidence but were met with a gunshot. Suddenly, Neha woke up and found herself in the bus sleeping on Rohan's shoulder. It was all a dream! But then she saw the same beggar from her dream, and abruptly asked Rohan to get off the bus.
