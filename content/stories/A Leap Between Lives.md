Aman's life on the ground floor was a tranquil affair, until the day his mischievous feline friend ventured onto the balcony roof. Determined to retrieve his elusive pet, he journeyed to the apartment above, but curiously, his neighbor's door remained eerily unresponsive.

Undeterred, Aman climbed onto the roof and ventured inside, only to confront a sight that defied reason. His eyes met the gaze of a mirror image, an identical twin. Aman 1 and Aman 2 engaged in an intense conversation, each astonished by the distinct paths their lives had taken due to choices made at different crossroads.

Their realization deepened when they prepared to descend via the stairs. Aman 1's world was plunged into bewildering confusion as he stepped onto a floor painted in vibrant purple, a stark departure from the soothing green that adorned their society.

Aman 2 the understood the rules governing their existence: for inhabitants of a specific floor, the use of stairs or lifts ensured the continuity of their current life. However, if one ventured between floors without these conventional means, they could enter the life of their counterpart.

It was a revelation that shook Aman's understanding of reality. Their paths had never crossed because they always adhered to the stairs or lifts. This newfound knowledge opened a Pandora's box of possibilities, a gateway to explore the myriad facets of their existence.

However, fate took a sinister turn when Aman 4, residing on the fourth floor, took a drastic step and plunged to the ground floor. Ground Floor inhabitants believed Aman 1 had taken his own life, while those on the fourth floor were mystified by Aman 4's inexplicable disappearance.

Amidst this turmoil, Aman 1, weary of his mundane existence, contemplated a daring leap. He yearned to experience the life that awaited him on the fourth floor, to embrace the unfamiliar.
