Ajay, a diligent college student, had always been known for his kind-hearted nature. On the day of his admission, he decided to share his joy with his fellow students by distributing sweets throughout the college campus. Little did he know that this innocent act of generosity would plunge him into a terrifying ordeal.

As the students gleefully indulged in the sweets Ajay had distributed, a sudden wave of nausea and sickness overcame them. Panic ensued as students began vomiting uncontrollably, and the campus was soon filled with distressing cries for help.

In the midst of the chaos, an ambulance was summoned to the scene. Sirens blaring, it arrived promptly, and paramedics began attending to the sick students. Ajay's close friend, Aman, anxiously decided to accompany them to the hospital to ensure they were okay.

However, just when it seemed like things were under control, another ambulance pulled up to the college gates. Ajay, puzzled by this unexpected arrival, rushed to the scene and informed the newcomers that an ambulance had already taken the ailing students to the hospital.

The paramedics from the second ambulance, looking equally perplexed, explained that they had been dispatched to this college specifically in response to an emergency call. Doubt began to creep into Ajay's mind, and he reached for his phone to contact Aman for clarification.

To his dismay, Aman's phone was switched off, sending a shiver of fear down Ajay's spine. Unable to reach his friend and increasingly suspicious of the situation, he decided to take matters into his own hands and called the local police. He recounted the bizarre events that had unfolded before him.

As Ajay awaited the arrival of the police, the second ambulance, now convinced that something was amiss, departed for what they believed was another emergency case. Ajay, determined to gather evidence, discreetly snapped a picture of the second ambulance's number plate.

Soon, the police arrived and listened intently to Ajay's story. Armed with the photograph of the second ambulance's number plate, they swiftly initiated an investigation. What they uncovered was a shocking revelation - the first ambulance that had arrived on the scene was not a real ambulance at all. It had been driven by kidnappers who had intercepted the emergency call.
